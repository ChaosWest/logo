Logo, Coat of Arms, Backdrop

Please use it, mess with it in all the crazy ways you want!
If you wanna make money for your own with it, I have to disappoint you. I made it for free, so use it free ;)
BUT: If you want to collect money for your awesome hackerspace or for amazing charity projects, 
you are welcome to sell stuff with the logo on it (sticker, shirts, tentacles, etc).
